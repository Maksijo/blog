### Краткая история казино.
Let’s start with breaking down what is an NFT. An NFT or Non-Fungible Token is data added to a file that creates a unique signature. It can be in the form of an image, a file, a song, a tweet, a text posted on a website, a physical item, and various other digital formats.

What makes NFTs so valuable is that even though anyone can own a digital file, NFTs are marked with a unique code to differentiate it from any digital replicas. NFT tech is a form of decentralized certification.

Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs are based on incredible technology. They can be referred to as a bridge that connects the real-world with the blockchain networks. This special, interlinking feature makes NFTs rare and expensive. In spite of being a novel technology, NFTs have often been tagged as fraudulent and bogus by many, especially during their early days.
