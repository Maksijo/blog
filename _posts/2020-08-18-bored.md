**Warning:**At first if somebody tell you secrets of life, meaning of life, or other doubtful things - fuck them. There are things nobody knows. In this blog i will try not to speak about this bullshit. 

All of people born on this planet completely different. Each person is unique. But I want to draw your attention on **bored** persons. Who is it? Let's figure out.

Definitely bored persons are dreamers. Each of bored persons like starry night sky, because stars, galaxy and our universe are pieces of mistery, that make bored persons happy. Bored persons can't stand any kind of routine. A school, an university, routine jobs, there are things, that terrify bored persons. Bored persons always try to entertain yourself. Why do i lose large sums of money in casino? Because i try to relieve the incurable boredom : )  Why do i learn crypto technology? Because i try to relieve the incurable boredom. And this list of actions go on and on. 

I've tried to explain my motivation to make this blog, to record my gambling losses and sometimes wins, to make first steps into crypto world, etc.
